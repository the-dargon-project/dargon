Roughly -2^6-2^6 is serialized as 1 byte
<=0: Vox Internal Types (see TypeId.cs)
1-99: CourierVoxTypes.

After 2^6-ish (we'll just say 100) TypeIds serialized as 2 bytes.
Of note, the lowest 6 bits are encoded first, then the following 8 bits.
For this reason, it's recommended to start applications at hexadecimal
VoxIds like 0xXY00

1000+: Standalone Applications

0x0100 - Derp

At roughly 2^13 (8192, 0x2000), TypeIDs get serialized as 3 bytes.
